"Not including employee and supervisor input at EQRS Summits. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 12"],
    "argument": "Excluding frontline employees and their immediate supervisors from EQRS Summits undermines the purpose of the meetings. These individuals possess firsthand experience with how attributes function"

"Failing to provide National NTEU with a telephonic or electronic briefing on Summit results and decisions. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 12"],
    "argument": "When the Employer fails to provide timely briefings to National NTEU following EQRS Summits, it obstructs information flow and diminishes transparency. These briefings are essential for"
    " informing the Union about any proposed changes, areas of concern, or agreed-upon action items resulting from the Summit. Without them, the Union is left without a clear understanding of next steps, cannot"

},
"Not affording the local Chapter an opportunity to discuss proposed changes with the Employer before employee group meetings.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 14"],
    "argument": "The Union must be granted an opportunity to review and discuss performance standard changes with management before the agency presents them to employees. This sequence ensures that any concerns"
    " or contract violations are addressed in advance, avoiding misinformation or confusion during formal rollout. When the Union is bypassed in this process, its ability to represent employees meaningfully is"

    "argument": "The contract clearly provides that departmental changes in standards must involve meetings that include Union representation. This requirement is not a formality; it is a safeguard to ensure"
    " the Union has a seat at the table when impactful decisions are made. Failure to convene these meetings prevents the Union from identifying potential violations, recommending improvements, or protecting"

},
"Using invalid or non-indicative performance data when issuing the employee’s annual appraisal. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 16"],
    "argument": "Relying on flawed, outdated, or misrepresentative performance data in an employee’s annual appraisal can lead to inaccurate and unjust ratings. Appraisals are meant to reflect actual"

},
"Failure to base Quality ratings on numerical standards established under Section 14.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "Quality performance ratings must be anchored in numerical standards explicitly established under Section 14 of Article 12. When the agency bypasses these standards or uses alternative criteria"

},
"Not using random sampling on a continuous (generally weekly) basis - All completed work must have an equal chance of selection. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "The use of random sampling on a continuous basis is critical for ensuring unbiased Quality evaluations. When the Employer fails to conduct weekly random samples, it increases the risk of"
    " cherry-picked work being used to evaluate employees. The contract mandates that each piece of completed work must have an equal chance of being selected, which ensures fairness and statistical integrity."
    " Without this safeguard, the sampling process becomes susceptible to manipulation or misrepresentation. Weekly sampling also ensures that the quality of work is assessed over time, not just during isolated"
    " periods. Skipping or altering this requirement violates the standards set in Article 12. Employees deserve assurance that their work is being evaluated using consistent and equitable practices. "
},
"Failure to maintain sampling system standards - Not maintaining the required 90% confidence level within ±2% sampling error. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "Statistical sampling must meet the required 90% confidence level and ±2% sampling error margin to be considered valid under the EQSP system. These parameters are critical to ensuring that"
    " Quality scores are statistically sound and defensible. If the Employer allows the sampling process to deviate from these thresholds, the resulting data becomes unreliable and potentially misleading. This"
    " directly violates the sampling methodology agreed upon in the contract. A flawed sampling system can unfairly impact employee ratings and diminish the credibility of the entire evaluation process."
    " Employees have a right to be rated using data derived from rigorous and statistically valid methods. The Employer must be held accountable when it fails to maintain these standards."
},
"Using defects or opportunities for error not defined in the DCI of the EQSP system - Any error must be properly documented using this tool.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "Performance defects must be documented using the officially recognized DCI (Defect Classification Instrument) within the EQSP system. When the Employer uses undefined or unofficial criteria to"
    " classify errors, it violates the established performance evaluation framework. The DCI provides clarity and consistency by defining which actions constitute defects and how they should be recorded."
    " Unauthorized deviations introduce subjectivity and confusion, which can unfairly harm employees. The contract ensures that only agreed-upon definitions are used in appraisals, preserving fairness and"

},
"Failure to apply the 2% adjustment in the employee’s favor when calculating “percent accurate” Quality scores.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "The contract explicitly allows for a 2% favorable adjustment when calculating Quality scores, ensuring employees are not penalized by minor statistical fluctuations. Failure to apply this"
    " adjustment violates the agreed-upon methodology for determining percent accuracy. This small margin of error is built in to provide a cushion against statistical anomalies or sampling imperfections. By"
    " neglecting to include it, the Employer inflates error rates and may assign lower ratings than warranted. This undermines the fairness and intent of the Quality scoring system. Employees are entitled to"

},
"Calculating a measured Quality rating: If employee did not spend 40% of direct time or 25% of total time on measured work — such a rating would be a violation. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 17"],
    "argument": "Measured Quality ratings are only appropriate when an employee has spent at least 40% of their direct time and 25% of their total time performing measured work. If these thresholds are not met,"
    " the rating must be unmeasured per contractual requirements. Assigning a measured rating under these conditions misrepresents the employee’s actual duties and performance. It also places employees at a"

},
"Using numerical standards not established in subsection 14C for Efficiency evaluations. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 18"],
    "argument": "Efficiency ratings must be based on numerical standards established in subsection 14C of Article 12. When alternative or unapproved standards are used, the Employer bypasses the collectively"

"Failing to base Efficiency scores on time-weighted OFP effectiveness calculations.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 18"],
    "argument": "Efficiency scores must be derived using time-weighted calculations that take into account the specific Operation/Function/Program (OFP) assignments of the employee. This method ensures that"
    " performance is evaluated in proportion to the time spent on each task. Ignoring this requirement results in skewed Efficiency scores that fail to reflect the actual workload distribution. It can unfairly"
    " penalize employees who spend more time on complex or less productive assignments. The contract mandates time-weighted OFP effectiveness to uphold accuracy in performance metrics. A failure to apply this"
    " calculation introduces systemic bias and undermines confidence in the evaluation process. It is essential that Efficiency ratings mirror real-world task allocation as intended. "
},
"Issuing a measured Efficiency rating when the employee did not meet the minimum time thresholds: At least 40% of direct time AND 25% of total time on measured work. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 18"],
    "argument": "Employees must meet minimum time thresholds—40% direct time and 25% total time on measured work—to receive a valid measured Efficiency rating. If an employee does not meet these thresholds,"
    " issuing a measured rating is a contractual violation. This provision is designed to ensure that Efficiency ratings are based on a sufficient quantity of measured data. Assigning a measured rating without"
    " adequate data leads to speculative and potentially unfair evaluations. The agreed-upon criteria prevent misuse of the measured rating system and protect employees from being judged on insufficient"
    " performance samples. Ratings must accurately reflect the proportion of work performed under measured conditions. Otherwise, the evaluation lacks credibility and contractual integrity. "
},
"Failure to provide required reports to affected employees, including: * Weekly Individual Performance Report (IPR) * Monthly IPR * Annual IPR * Employee Performance Standards for Efficiency and Quality"
" Report * Operation Rating Statistics by Team Report (must be posted) ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "This failure denies employees access to critical information necessary for understanding their performance expectations and progress throughout the rating period. The reports outlined are"
    " contractually required and form the foundation for transparency in evaluating both individual and team-based performance. Without timely and consistent delivery of these documents, employees may be"
    " blindsided by appraisals or disciplinary action based on metrics they were never given the opportunity to understand or address. The Weekly and Monthly IPRs serve as essential feedback loops, while the"
    " Annual IPR is required for any rating to be valid. The absence of Efficiency and Quality Standards Reports hinders employees' ability to align work output with performance expectations. The Operation"
    " Rating Statistics by Team Report must also be provided to promote team-level transparency and accountability. Failing to provide these reports represents a systemic breakdown of fair and transparent"
    " performance management. "
},
"Delays in distributing reports (e.g., not providing them in a timely, consistent manner). ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Delays in providing performance reports defeat the intended purpose of these documents—to allow employees to understand and respond to performance trends as they occur. Timely delivery of"
    " Weekly and Monthly IPRs ensures employees have a real-time grasp of where they stand and can make adjustments to improve before appraisal decisions are finalized. Delayed or sporadic reporting creates"
    " confusion and undermines both individual accountability and management credibility. Additionally, when reports arrive late, employees may be unable to verify data accuracy or challenge discrepancies in"
    " time. The Union is also denied the ability to intervene or investigate potential systemic issues in a timely manner. Contractual language requires consistency and predictability in performance"
    " communication. Unexplained delays violate that obligation and deprive employees of fair notice and due process. "
},
"Failure to post Operation Rating Statistics by Team in the unit, denying employees access to required transparency on team-level data. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "This report provides employees with comparative insight into how their team is performing in relation to others, which is vital for ensuring fairness across operations. Not posting these"
    " statistics creates a transparency void that prevents employees from contextualizing their performance within the broader team environment. The data helps employees assess whether ratings are applied"
    " consistently and equitably across different teams or shifts. When this report is not posted as required, it creates an environment of secrecy that invites speculation about favoritism or arbitrary"
    " evaluations. Furthermore, the absence of this team-level data interferes with the Union’s ability to identify disparities or patterns of misapplication in ratings. Contract language mandates the regular"
    " posting of this report for exactly these reasons. Failing to do so violates both the spirit and the letter of agreed-upon transparency measures. "
},
"Failure to provide any of the following reports to the Union, either regularly or upon request: * Mid-Quarter/Quarterly Efficiency Performance Report * Mid-Quarter/Quarterly Quality Performance Report"

" for Efficiency Report * Employee Performance Standards for Efficiency and Quality Report ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "These reports are essential for the Union to fulfill its representational obligations and monitor the fairness and consistency of the performance appraisal system. Without them, the Union is"
    " prevented from identifying systemic issues, addressing member concerns, or challenging inappropriate appraisal practices. Many of these reports—such as the Calculated Base Points and the Center Ratings—are"
    " integral to understanding whether ratings are derived from valid statistical measures. The Union has a contractual right to this information under Article 12 and Article 9 to ensure accountability at all"

    " obligations to provide relevant and necessary information under 5 U.S.C. §7114(b)(4). The Employer must honor both the contract and statutory duty to supply requested performance-related data in a timely"
    " manner. "
},
"Not retaining reports in Control-D for at least one (1) year.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Failure to maintain reports in Control-D for the required one-year period significantly hampers both employee rights and Union representational functions. The one-year retention policy exists to"
    " ensure that historical performance data is available for review, comparison, and, if needed, dispute resolution. Deleting or otherwise removing reports prematurely can prevent employees from contesting"
    " unfair appraisals or identifying patterns in their performance trajectory. It also prevents the Union from conducting longitudinal analysis of departmental or systemic trends. The removal of this data"
    " raises serious transparency and accountability concerns. Contractual provisions exist to ensure report accessibility precisely because of these risks. Not retaining reports violates those provisions and"
    " weakens the integrity of the entire performance system."
},
"Failure to provide the National Rating Statistics by Service Center Report to National NTEU quarterly (except for the June quarter). ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "This report is critical for identifying national-level trends in performance ratings and ensuring consistency across service centers. Without it, the National Union cannot assess whether rating"
    " distributions are being applied equitably or whether systemic rating inflation or deflation is occurring. It also impedes the Union’s ability to raise national policy concerns or pursue negotiated"
    " improvements in rating practices. This quarterly report—excluding June—is a contractual requirement that exists to protect employees from disparate treatment across the IRS. Its absence compromises both"
    " oversight and employee trust. The Employer has a clear obligation to provide it as part of ongoing labor-management cooperation at the national level. "
},
"Denial of additional reasonable and necessary information requested by the Union for representational purposes. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Under 5 U.S.C. §7114(b)(4), the Union is entitled to information that is necessary for representation, including data that supports grievances, unfair labor practice complaints, or other"
    " actions. When the Employer refuses to provide such information, it impairs the Union’s ability to fulfill its statutory role. The standard of “reasonable and necessary” does not permit arbitrary denials,"
    " particularly where the information is directly tied to workplace conditions, performance appraisals, or disciplinary actions. These refusals also interfere with the grievance process and may constitute an"
    " unfair labor practice. The contract further reinforces the right to information relevant to the Union’s duties. The Employer must not impose unjustified barriers to access, especially when timely data"
    " can make or break a representative case. "
},
"Failure to hold quarterly meetings at the Operation level (or equivalent) upon Union request to review and discuss these reports.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Quarterly meetings at the operational level are a critical tool for labor-management communication and early intervention in performance management issues. When the Employer fails to hold these"
    " meetings, especially after the Union requests them, it erodes trust and prevents collaboration on improving workplace practices. These meetings provide an opportunity to clarify trends, raise concerns, and"
    " resolve potential disputes before they escalate. They also allow the Union to advocate for fairness and consistency in how performance expectations are being met and measured. Refusing to convene these"
    " meetings limits transparency and may result in avoidable grievances. The contractual language clearly supports the Union’s right to request and participate in these reviews. The Employer’s failure to hold"
    " them constitutes a breakdown in the collaborative process required under the agreement. "
},
"Improper denial of Union attendance or official time for these meetings, violating Article 12 Section 14E.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Union representatives are entitled to official time to attend meetings involving performance data review and discussions with management. Denying access or attendance undermines the Union’s"
    " representational rights and may violate the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith. Official time is explicitly intended to allow the Union to monitor compliance with performance agreements and protect"
    " bargaining unit employees from unfair or arbitrary ratings. Article 12, Section 14E outlines the conditions under which Union attendance is expected and supports the principle of joint oversight of rating"
    " processes. Blocking attendance, refusing to grant official time, or discouraging participation is a direct interference in representational activity. Such conduct is not only contractually prohibited but"
    " may constitute an unfair labor practice. "
},
"Failure to provide each center Chapter with: * A dedicated PC * A printer * Software needed to access and use the data ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "These resources are necessary for the Union to analyze and interpret performance data, especially large sets accessed through Control-D or similar systems. Without a dedicated workstation and"
    " printer, Chapters cannot fulfill their obligations to monitor rating systems, review performance reports, or prepare grievances effectively. The equipment outlined is not optional; it is a contractual"
    " requirement intended to facilitate meaningful representation. The lack of access to such tools significantly limits the Union’s ability to act promptly and with accuracy. These deficiencies may delay or"
    " hinder Union responses to performance-related actions taken against employees. The Employer’s obligation includes not only providing the equipment but ensuring it is functional and up to date. Failure to"
    " meet this requirement obstructs the representational process. "
},
"Failure to ensure the equipment is exclusively for Union representational use and maintained by the Employer. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Designating the equipment solely for Union representational activity ensures data security, accountability, and uninterrupted access to critical information. When the equipment is shared with"
    " others or repurposed, Union representatives lose reliable access and may be exposed to unauthorized data viewing. Moreover, the Employer’s failure to maintain the equipment results in downtime and reduces"
    " the Union’s capacity to act in time-sensitive matters. These resources are contractually mandated for the Union’s exclusive use. Proper maintenance is the Employer’s responsibility under the agreement."
    " Failing to safeguard and support this infrastructure undercuts the Union’s ability to represent employees effectively. "
},
"Failure to grant Control-D access to the designated Chapter President or MEPS Coordinator using the provided equipment. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "Control-D access is a vital tool for retrieving, analyzing, and reviewing performance data, which forms the basis of many grievances and systemic performance disputes. When the Employer refuses"
    " to provide access to the Chapter President or designated MEPS Coordinator, it disables a core function of representational activity. The Union cannot be expected to advocate effectively without access to"
    " the data driving appraisals and ratings. This failure obstructs the flow of information necessary for transparency and timely intervention. The contractual and statutory right to access relevant data"
    " includes the systems used to store and generate that data. Blocking or delaying access to Control-D undermines representational integrity and violates the clear intent of the agreement. "
},
"Failure to adjust report delivery and structure for other components outside Submission Processing where measured plans are in use and mutually agreed upon. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 19"],
    "argument": "When components outside of Submission Processing have agreed-upon measured plans in place, the Employer is required to adjust the delivery and structure of performance reports accordingly."
    " Failing to do so undermines the intent of these mutual agreements and results in inaccurate or inconsistent data tracking. Employees in these components may be disadvantaged by receiving reports that do"
    " not reflect their actual performance metrics or expectations. Such discrepancies hinder fair evaluation and violate the principles of transparency and mutual understanding outlined in the contract. It is"
    " essential that report formats and delivery timelines be tailored to the operational context. Anything less creates inequity and confusion in performance management. "
},
"Failure to charge time spent at: * The health unit * Preparing Forms 3081 * Group meetings in a uniform manner throughout a center": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "Time spent in the health unit, completing Form 3081s, or attending group meetings must be charged consistently across all employees and groups in a center. When this time is inconsistently or"
    " inaccurately charged, it creates discrepancies in Efficiency scores and undermines the integrity of performance data. Uniform treatment ensures that no employee is unfairly penalized or advantaged based"
    " on non-work factors. This is especially critical when such time can significantly impact time-weighted metrics like OFP effectiveness. Disparate treatment across teams or individuals violates the"
    " principle of equitable application of performance standards. Such errors must be corrected to maintain credibility in appraisal outcomes. "
},
"Charging administrative functions (like prep or meetings) as direct time instead of correctly separating them. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "Charging administrative time as direct time inflates measured work time and distorts Efficiency calculations. Prep time, meetings, and similar activities are non-direct and should be recorded"
    " separately to avoid misrepresentation of actual productivity. When incorrectly charged, this inflates expectations and penalizes employees unfairly, especially if they are unable to meet skewed"
    " productivity baselines. These misclassifications result in flawed appraisals and can influence decisions regarding awards, promotions, or discipline. It is the Employer’s responsibility to ensure proper"
    " coding and accounting practices. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of fair and accurate performance assessment practices. "
},
"Holding an employee accountable for work under a skill code without assigning the appropriate skill code.": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "Employees must only be evaluated under skill codes they are officially assigned to. Holding them accountable for unassigned skill codes misrepresents both the employee's responsibilities and"
    " the expectations attached to their role. Such actions may also violate procedures related to skill code assignment and proficiency verification. Without proper documentation of skill code assignment, any"
    " performance data attributed to that code lacks validity. This compromises both Quality and Efficiency metrics and may lead to unjustified ratings. The Employer must ensure all performance measures are"
    " aligned with properly assigned duties. "
},
"Failure to automatically join grievances when: * A grievance over an annual rating is filed * Followed by a grievance over a related personnel action (e.g., WGI denial, promotion) ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "When a grievance over a personnel action stems from a contested annual rating, the Employer must automatically join the two cases. Failure to do so fragments the process and risks inconsistent"
    " resolutions. This procedural oversight can delay outcomes and diminish the Union’s ability to advocate effectively. The linkage between rating and personnel actions is recognized in contract language and"
    " must be reflected in grievance processing. Without consolidation, employees are forced to duplicate arguments and evidence, which undermines representational efficiency. Automatic joinder protects both"
    " due process and administrative coherence. "
},
"Using performance data that is: * Not valid (i.e., inaccurate or corrupted) * Not indicative (i.e., doesn’t reflect actual employee performance) to support a measured rating": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "Performance appraisals must rely on data that is both valid and indicative of actual work. Using corrupted, incomplete, or irrelevant data not only skews results but fundamentally violates"
    " employee rights. Appraisals based on such data erode trust in the system and can lead to unfair personnel decisions. The contract requires that any data used must accurately reflect the employee’s work"
    " environment and actual output. If the data cannot meet this standard, it should not be used for evaluative purposes. The Employer’s reliance on flawed data must be addressed and corrected to ensure fair"
    " evaluations. "
},
"Failing to issue an unmeasured rating when the data is determined not valid and indicative. ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "When performance data is deemed invalid or non-indicative, the Employer must issue an unmeasured rating. Continuing with a measured rating under these conditions misrepresents the employee’s"
    " performance and breaches contractual safeguards. This requirement protects employees from being rated on flawed or incomplete records. Failing to issue an unmeasured rating also obstructs the Union's"
    " ability to represent the employee effectively. The Employer must evaluate each case individually and determine whether data supports a fair appraisal. If not, the fallback must always be an unmeasured"
    " rating to preserve the integrity of the system. "
},
"Applying incorrect National Quality and Efficiency ranges. Ranges are as follows: Quality: 2 = 77, 3 = 95, 4 = 125, 5 = 140 / Efficiency: 2 = 70, 3 = 90, 4 = 120, 5 = 140 ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "The contract clearly defines the numerical thresholds for each performance rating level. Applying incorrect ranges can result in over- or under-rating employees, which carries serious"
    " implications for awards, promotions, or other personnel actions. These established benchmarks ensure standardization across the service and must be strictly followed. Deviating from the correct ranges"
    " violates both the letter and spirit of negotiated performance standards. Employees deserve to be rated according to the metrics agreed upon by both the Agency and the Union. Any error in applying these"
    " numbers must be corrected to uphold fairness. "
},
"Using data collected during a learning curve in: * Measured database * Evaluative recordations * Annual appraisals ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 20"],
    "argument": "Performance data collected while an employee is in a learning curve is inherently not indicative of their actual productivity or proficiency. Including this data in measured databases or"
    " evaluations violates basic fairness and skews appraisal results. Employees must be given the opportunity to build competence before their work is subject to evaluation. Using learning curve data ignores"
    " the developmental nature of the assignment and inflates error rates or lowers efficiency unfairly. The Employer is obligated to exclude this data when it doesn’t accurately reflect mature performance."
    " Appraisals must be based on stabilized performance metrics. "
},
"Failing to designate work as a High Quality Function (HQF) when it achieves ≥ 97% accuracy in a quarter ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "When a function reaches or exceeds 97% accuracy in a quarter, it must be designated as a High Quality Function (HQF). Failure to do so withholds benefits and protections employees are entitled"
    " to, such as exemptions from Individual Quality Review (IQR). HQF designation ensures that employees are not needlessly subjected to redundant quality monitoring. It also reflects a high level of employee"
    " proficiency and system-wide efficiency. The Employer must timely review accuracy data and assign HQF status accordingly. Omitting this step penalizes excellent performance and undermines contractual"
    " obligations. "
},
"Failure to: * Cease Individual Quality Review (IQR) in an HQF * Replace IQR with Product Review (PR) * Automatically grant a 5 in Efficiency to employees working that HQF ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "Once an operation is designated as an HQF, the Employer must stop using IQR and begin using PR as the quality oversight tool. Continued use of IQR in such circumstances is not only unnecessary"
    " but a direct violation of negotiated procedures. Employees working in an HQF are also entitled to an automatic 5 in Efficiency, recognizing the high standards of the function. Denial of these provisions"
    " ignores employee achievement and erodes trust in the performance system. The Employer’s failure to transition review methods and assign the appropriate rating must be remedied. These procedural steps"
    " exist to reward and incentivize high-quality work and must be enforced consistently."
},
"Failing to hold a Union meeting prior to reverting an OFP from HQF back to IQR": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "The Employer is obligated to notify and meet with the Union before changing the review structure of an Operation Function Position (OFP) from a High Quality Function (HQF) to Individual Quality"
    " Review (IQR). This requirement ensures transparency, allows for Union input on the impact to affected employees, and supports the Union’s right to engage in pre-decisional discussions on performance"
    " evaluation processes. Bypassing this meeting eliminates the Union's ability to advocate for fair assessment standards. Employees may then be subjected to increased scrutiny or different expectations"
    " without warning or explanation. This undermines both employee trust and the collective bargaining process. Failing to engage in the required meeting constitutes a procedural violation that has a direct"
    " impact on representational rights. "
},
"Reverting to IQR without verifying accuracy at the 8th week or failing to notify employees ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "When an OFP is reverted from HQF back to IQR, the Employer must first confirm that the operation’s quality has dropped below the 97% threshold by the 8th week of the following quarter. Without"
    " this verification, the change in review process is unsupported and potentially unjustified. Additionally, employees must be formally notified of such reversion so they can adjust their work accordingly."
    " Failing to meet either requirement introduces ambiguity and prevents employees from understanding how they are being assessed. The lack of verification and notice creates confusion and opens the door to"
    " inconsistent or punitive evaluations. This undermines the fairness of the performance review process and violates both procedural safeguards and the integrity of the evaluation system. "
},
"Issuing a measured evaluation to an employee who has not worked measured work for at least 60 days ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "Performance evaluations based on measured data must only be applied when the employee has engaged in measured work for at least 60 cumulative days. This ensures that any resulting rating is based"
    " on a representative and meaningful sample of performance. Issuing a measured rating without meeting this threshold introduces statistical bias and misrepresents the employee's actual performance level. It"
    " can lead to unjust ratings, lower awards, or even denials of promotions or within-grade increases. This approach penalizes employees who may have spent significant time on unmeasured work or who were"
    " reassigned due to business needs. The failure to meet the 60-day standard makes the evaluation invalid and inappropriate for use in annual performance appraisals. "
},
"Including learning curve data in the measured database or annual evaluation ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "Learning curve data reflects a period when employees are still acquiring proficiency and should not be used in measured performance databases or final evaluations. Including this data skews"
    " efficiency and quality metrics downward, creating an inaccurate portrayal of the employee’s abilities. This practice contradicts agreed-upon standards that protect employees from being held accountable"
    " for productivity during a training or adaptation phase. It also leads to artificially low ratings and may unjustly influence award eligibility or career progression. Employees deserve to be evaluated only"
    " once they are fully trained and capable of operating at expected levels. Using learning curve data in this manner is both misleading and a violation of fair performance evaluation principles. "
},
"Using low-hour data (as defined in IRM 3.43.405) for Efficiency if base points were added": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21", "IRM 3.43.405"],
    "argument": "Low-hour data, as outlined in IRM 3.43.405, does not yield reliable performance metrics and should not be used for Efficiency evaluations, especially when base points have been artificially"
    " added. Doing so introduces bias and disproportionately affects employees who may have had limited hours due to operational factors outside their control. This practice results in inflated expectations"
    " that are not reflective of actual working conditions. When employees are rated based on such data, it distorts their performance record and may negatively affect awards, promotions, or ratings. The"
    " integrity of the performance system relies on consistent, accurate, and indicative data usage. Applying low-hour data in this context violates that standard and penalizes employees unfairly. "
},
"Using data from OFPs with fewer than 6 employees working them in a quarter": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "To maintain data validity, performance statistics should not be drawn from OFPs where fewer than six employees worked during a quarter. Small sample sizes result in unreliable averages and can"
    " disproportionately affect individual ratings. The standard exists to ensure statistical integrity and prevent outlier performance from skewing the evaluative baseline. Using data from such limited"
    " operations introduces volatility and undermines employee confidence in the fairness of the system. Ratings based on these figures may not represent actual employee effort or capability. Continuing this"
    " practice despite contractual and procedural guidelines results in an unjustified evaluation methodology. "
},
"Setting unreasonable base points or failing to: * Ensure MEPS system deletes added base points * Use only valid and indicative data to rate * Use national prior-year quarterly average for Quality"
" Base Points ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21"],
    "argument": "Base points must be reasonable, transparent, and reflective of standard work conditions. When they are inflated or when the MEPS system fails to delete added base points, employees are unfairly"
    " held to unattainable standards. Ratings must be based on data that is both valid (accurate) and indicative (reflective of actual performance), not skewed by administrative error or manipulation. The"
    " contract also requires use of the national prior-year quarterly average for determining Quality Base Points to ensure consistency and equity across locations. Deviation from these standards introduces"
    " inconsistency in evaluations and leads to potential grievances or employee dissatisfaction. Such practices distort the intended balance of fairness in the performance system. "
},
"Using prior (now deleted) agreements to justify: Holding lower-graded employees to lower standards ": {
    "articles": ["Article 12 Section 21 "],
    "argument": "The Employer cannot rely on prior agreements that have since been deleted or nullified to justify reduced standards for lower-graded employees. Doing so bypasses current negotiated policies"
    " and introduces outdated, potentially discriminatory benchmarks into performance expectations. All employees, regardless of grade, must be held to consistent and contractually valid standards that reflect"
    " their actual duties and responsibilities. Continuing to use expired agreements undercuts the purpose of contract revisions and erodes trust in the evaluation process. It also misleads both management"
    " and employees about what performance expectations are appropriate and enforceable. This practice constitutes a direct violation of negotiated agreements and undermines their intended application. "
